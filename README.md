While studying electronics, and more specifically the components of a computer's microarchitecture — such as processors and different types of memory, for example — I realized that there was 
a real bridge between hardware and software.

The purpose of this document is to explain how a circuit I designed works after becoming interested in arithmetic calculation circuits — Floating Point Units — on floating point numbers.  

I am not a specialist, and it is possible that some elements of my circuit are not optimal, either in terms of complexity, architecture, or the proximity of circuits, which could lead 
to constraints due to certain physical limitations.
There is no order of magnitude in the diagram.

The document is divided into three phases:
  i - a first phase contextualizing the problem that the circuit aims to solve
  ii - a second phase explaining how the circuit works
  iii - a third phase with the small mathematical demonstration that was used to conceptualize the circuit
